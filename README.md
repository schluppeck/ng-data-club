## Code of conduct

We have a [code of conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) that applies to our meetings, emails, MS Teams, github discussion forum and other interactions. Please have a look at it.

## Ideas for meetings / wishlist

We will try to keep meetings informal with some guided discussion by presenters that will change week by week.

Structure will be around:

1. *I want answer the following question with my data... How do I do that?* and/or
2. *I know the following technique, which could help you with bla...*

## 2022-11-23 - first meeting

- [the slides](./2022-11-23-first-meeting.html) from the first meeting
- [meeting-notes](./2022-11-23-meeting-notes.md)
- [some potential, additional ideas](./wishlist.md)
