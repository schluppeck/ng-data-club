- organising
- analysing
- visualising

## Github repo

You can find notes, presentations, and code at the [ng-data-club github repository](https://github.com/schluppeck/ng-data-club).

## Discussion forum

You can also check out the [github discussion forum](https://github.com/schluppeck/ng-data-club/discussions) for the data club. A good place to share ideas, links, etc.

## Code of conduct

We have a [code of conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) that applies to our meetings, emails, MS Teams, github discussion forum and other interactions. Please have a look at it.

## Ideas for meetings / wishlist

We will try to keep meetings informal with some guided discussion by presenters that will change week by week.

Structure will be around:

1. *I want answer the following question with my data... How do I do that?* and/or
2. *I know the following technique, which could help you with bla...*

## 2022-11-23 - first meeting
