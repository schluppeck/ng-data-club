    "text": "Worked examples with data from the Efron & Tibshirani book\nSome thoughts on computationally expensive methods. To get some hands on the basics, let’s have a look at a basic example (from Chapter 2 in the book. Table 2.1), in which survival data from mouse in a treatment / control experiment are presented.\nI decided to use julia in this notebook, but it shouldn’t be hard to reproduce in R, python, matlab, or your own preferred method of working with and plotting data.\nThe julia packages required are listed in the Project.toml and Manifest.toml. You should be able to download the folder from the github repo and import Pkg follwed by Pkg.activate(\".\") and Pkg.instantiate().\n\n\nCode\nusing Bootstrap\nusing Statistics\nusing Plots\ngr(); # activate gr backend\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# data from Table 2.1 in Efron & Tibshirani book\ntreatment = [94,197,16,38,99,141,23];\ncontrol = [52,104,146,10,51,30,40,27,46];\n\nplot(treatment,ones(size(treatment)), line=:stem, color=:red, lw=2, label=\"Treatment\")\nplot!(control,ones(size(treatment)), line=:stem, \n        color=:blue, lw=2, label=\"Control\",\n        size=[600,100], ylim=[0, 1.2], \n        legend = :outertopright, yticks=[0,1],\n        title = \"Efron & Tibshirani murine example\", \n        titlefont = font(10,\"Arial\"),\n        titlefonthaligns=:right,\n        tickfont = font(10,\"Arial\"),\n        legendfont = font(10,\"Arial\"))\nxaxis!(label=\"Survival time (days)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBootstrap of the median\nNow we can create 10000 bootstrap samples from the treatment and control data - making sure to respect the size of each list/vector, and to use sampling with replacement*.\n\n\nCode\n## basic bootstrap of the \"median\" treatment data\n@time bs1 = bootstrap(median, treatment, BasicSampling(n_boot))\n\n\n  0.369251 seconds (809.74 k allocations: 41.080 MiB, 2.26% gc time, 99.74% compilation time)\n\n\nBootstrap Sampling\n  Estimates:\n     Var │ Estimate  Bias      StdError\n         │ Float64   Float64   Float64\n    ─────┼──────────────────────────────\n       1 │     94.0  -13.6295   37.6526\n  Sampling: BasicSampling\n  Samples:  10000\n  Data:     Vector{Int64}: { 7 }\n\n\nThe Bootstrap.jl package (see documentation) also has tools for getting confidence intervals, and extracting other info like # of observations, etc\n\n## calculate 95% confidence intervals\ncil = 0.95;\n\n## basic CI\nbci1 = confint(bs1, BasicConfInt(cil));\n\n## percentile CI\nbci2 = confint(bs1, PercentileConfInt(cil));\n\n## BCa CI\nbci3 = confint(bs1, BCaConfInt(cil));\n\n## Normal CI\nbci4 = confint(bs1, NormalConfInt(cil));\n\nwhich lets you compare, e.g. the normal confidence interval (94.0, 33.83184038161308, 181.4271596183869), with the percentile confidence interval (94.0, 23.0, 141.0).\nTo visualise the distribution of bootstrapped medians, we can get them with straps() and use the histogram() function from Plots.jl. The bootstrap estimate of the standard error of the statistic of interest can be obtained from the standard deviation of the bootstrap replications.
