## Where, when?

Meeting time + place

- Wednesday, 12:00-12:45, weekly
- a seminar room like this here? (or somewhere else?)

## What

Could structure things according to

1. *I want to answer the following question with my data... How do I do that?* 

2. *I know the following technique, which could help you with [bla]...*

3. Other format?

## What 2

- Want to share knowledge of *principles* / intuition / maths background
- ... but also practical advice:
  + tools 
  + code snippets (multi-lingual?)

## Padlet link + Team + resources

- https://padlet.com/denisschluppeck/ng_data_club
- MS Team (for chat / ad-hoc questions)
- github repo, gists (for sharing code )

 
## Lots of potential topics {.scrollable}

- PCA, ICA, related methods
- linear regression, basics of linear algebra?
- "dimensionality reduction"
- t-SNE
- basic ideas behind solving inverse problems
- how do people organise data, meta-data
- "Tidy Data" / tidyverse and related ideas (in `r`), Pandas (`python`), Tables (`matlab`). Long and wide data? `select`, `filter`, `mutate`, `summarise` (`dplyr`/`sql` syntax) 
- logistic regression
- intro to bayesian stats/estimation?
- more machine learning stuff (`svm`, intro to deep learning models)
- RL?

## Notes from first meeting

- Time slot, lunchtime, 12:00-12:45 seems good
- Room, TBC (depending on availability)
- General mix of sessions that address "questions" and "available tools/techniques" sounded good to people
- There were lots of good suggestions for what to cover

## Suggested Topics

- Missing data
- Visualization
- code/data sharing
- Stat tests
- Linear regression (MvR)
- Bugs
- Code style guide (MvR)
- Software tools
- Pandas
- Bring You Own Problem (**BYOP**)
- DAGs / directed ayclic graphs
- inferring causality from non-experimental data (e.g., selection models, instrumental variables, difference-in-difference)

## Initial Schedule

1. 2022-11-30: Tomas: `julia` and code sharing

2. 2022-12-07: Helen, Bring your own problem, BYOP (data visualisation)

3. 2022-12-14: Hazem, thinking about, choosing appropriate statistical tests

## Future

- Roni & MvR: Hidden Markov Models

- Denis & Jan: mixing code and writing; documents, webpages, presentations

## Actions

- [ ] send e-mail with details of upcoming meetings to `lp-notug` [ds]
- [ ] sort out recurring room [ds]
- [ ] consider moving emails/discussion to Teams [ds, maybe after away day in 2023]
