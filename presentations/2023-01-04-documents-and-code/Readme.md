# Mixing text and computations

## What

Mixing text + computations, Markdown, `quarto`, webpages, `pandoc`

Markdown is a simple, easy-to-use markup language perfect for use in a text editor. There are now tons of tools that allow you to turn text with simple typographic bits of markup (# headings, *italics*, **bold**, etc) into nice looking documents, webpages, presentations, … I will give a brief overview and talk about why I think it’s useful.


- the rendered `revealjs` slides I used are [[at this link][md-slides]]
- the raw `qmd` file for the presentation is [00-presentation.qmd](./00-presentation.qmd)

The derived files are in docx, html and pdf document...

00-presentation.docx
00-presentation.html
00-presentation.pdf

## including computations

Check out the [[github repo][ghrepo]) for code examples n `julia`, `python` and `r`:

- [01-doc-with-julia.qmd](./01-doc-with-julia.qmd)
- [01-doc-with-python.qmd](./01-doc-with-python.qmd)
- [01-doc-with-r.qmd](./01-doc-with-r.qmd)
