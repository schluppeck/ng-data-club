## E-notebooks

>think about e-notebooks

Hazem's references for tips for choosing an e-notebook:

- <https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05895-3>

## Tidy data

DS was not at session, but ideas around organising data came up

>keep your tabular data “tidy” 

- [the concept of tidy data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html#:~:text=There%20are%20three,its%20own%20cell)
- <https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html>

This idea leads to a whole bunch of nice properties and tools for manipulating tabular data (selecting columns, filtering rows, statistical plotting,...) which is often a big win.
