## Some discussion points from the session

[ds]

- intro: difference in cultures between maths/engineering/physics and psychology on how stats is taught and introduced during training. 
- Psychology has a particular way of teaching this - emphasis on linear regression, ANOVA, experimental design.
- even though other discipiplines often require much stronger quantitative skills, intuition for experimental design / stats / analysis of data sets common in neuroscience and psychology is not a given
- **pop-quiz**: based on figure from paper... is there sufficient information in this plot + description for you to accept the conclusions?
- two levels of issue: **reasoning about stats**, significance, p-values, etc is hard (and even experienced pracitioners make mistakes), **appropriateness of techniques/techinical details** may not always be correct (people often stick with what they know, have learnt before)
- visual short-cuts from graphs that look like they may imply a significant difference can be misleading
- [see slides for some more pointers]
