# Non-normal stats

*Non-Normal, No Problem: A Crash Course in Non-Parametric Statistics*

James Read-Tannock, Madan Lab

- the basic concept of permutation testing and bootstrapping 
- some applications for ERPs, testing differences in gray matter thickness associated with different markers (using `spin permutation` for freesurfer data)
- discussion

There are also [some notes from DS](./2024-11-19-non-normal-stats/2024-11-19-non-normal-stats.html) with links to PDFs, webpages, and including snippets of `julia` code for experimenting with bootstrap / permutation testing.
